The requirements for the weight tracking app included creating a database with three tables to store daily weight, goal weight, and user information. The user needs this app was designed to address include the ability to track their weight and be notified when their goal weight has been reached. There were 2 screens that were necessary which included a login screen and a grid screen to display data. I added 2 additional screens which included a registration screen and a notification screen. The additional screens prevented confusion and an overload of information on any single screen. 

To code the app, I started in small sections and built upon them as I added additional features. To test the code, I used use cases and ran through the steps to ensure that the app worked in a way that was user friendly and easily understandable. It helped point out any bugs and defects that needed to be fixed. I ran into some issues when attempting to add tables to my database. After watching tutorials and reading forums, I discovered that changing the database version was the solution to my problem. For this project, I found that I was particularly successful at creating the login and registration pages of the application. They were created in a way that was both user friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
